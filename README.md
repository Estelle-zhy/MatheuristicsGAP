Accompanying code for the text "Matheuristics"
The code (currently incomplete) is meant for exemplificatory purpose only. It provides the gist of each approach and possibly roots for developing specialized, efficient codes.
The code should NOT be used to draw comparative conclusions, objective of its design is to keep it as simple and barebone as possible.
